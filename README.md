# Ad Viewability Code
After cloning the Repo just run index.html in chrome browser and check the results on console and on fixed div on page.

# Points Covered

1) Measured the viewability of the DIV that contains the ad.
2) Determined viewability also by evaluating the windows focus state (tab change, window unfocused).
3) Managed whether user is active or not.
4) Measured the portion of the ad that is visible in percentage.
5) Considerd Ad as visible if portion visible is greater than 50%.
6) User Inactivity timeout is set as 15s.
7) Rendered results on the page for better viewability also console contains the results if one is interested in it.
